Uses instructionAPI version 1.1.

32bit libraries are in instructionAPI/i386-unknown-linux2.4
- I had to build the 32-bit version of libcommon.so from source,
the distributed copy of libcommon.so couldn't find the symbol
cplus_demangle at link time (linking libbfd didn't seem to help)

64bit libraries are in instructionAPI/x86_64-unknown-linux2.4
